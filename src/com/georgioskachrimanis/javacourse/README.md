**Wall Area**

Write a class with the name Wall. The class needs 2 fields(instance variables) with name width and height of type double.

The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have any parameters (no-arg constructor). 
The second constructor has parameters width and height of type double and it needs to initialize the fields.
In case the width is less than 0 it needs to set the width value to 0. The same ois true for the height parameter.

Write the following methods (instance methods):

1. Method named getWidth without any parameters, it needs to return the value of width field.
2. Method name getHeight without any parameters, it needs to return the value of height field.
3. Method named setWidth, and method setHeight with one parameter each of the double value. 
   If, any of the values is less than 0 it needs to set the value to 0.4.
4.Method getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the area of thr wall.
